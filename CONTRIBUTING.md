## Goal of this Repository

To create and maintain a free, intelligent, flashcard repository for data science together. 

### How Goal is Achieved

Anki flashcards ([VIDEO](https://youtu.be/FHVOAr8MxxQ?t=88), [DOWNLOAD](https://apps.ankiweb.net), and [ARTICLE](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-spaced-repetition-with-anki-to-learn-to-code-faster-7c334d448c3c/)),
Cloze Deletion ([VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRY1rYxd9EM) and [MANUAL](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#cloze-deletion)), and

#### More about Anki

Anki is a free, intelligent, flashcard system that maximizes learning and minimizes repetition.

Make sure you watch how to [make optimal flashcards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbvaITy3oeQ) as well because if you make bad Anki cards, this will demotivate you and probably make you feel like you’re wasting your time. As well, **making optimal Anki flashcards is a requirement if you wish to contribute flashcards to this repository**.

While Anki does have data science decks already uploaded, most are not optimized for learning and frequently violate the [minimum information principle](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Minimum_information_principle).

## How to Contribute

Ways to contribute:
 - Create Anki cloze deletion flashcards and upload them to this repository
 - Make this repository more beautiful by reading:
   - [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and adding tables, images, etc
   - [36 Amazing Python Open Source Projects (v.2019)](https://medium.mybridge.co/36-amazing-python-open-source-projects-v-2019-2fe058d79450) to get a sense of what beautiful projects look like
   - [Starting an Open Source Project guide](https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/)
 - Correct anything: mistakes on any flashcards, grammatical errors on the repository, or missing words anywhere (unless omitted for spacing issues on flashcards)
 - Clarify anything: hard-to-understand paragraphs, etc.

## Setting up

Here's what you'll need to read/download to understand what we'll be doing:

1. All of the links in **Goal of this Repository** to understand Anki
2. https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki/blob/master/README.md to understand how to share Anki decks
3. https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778 to put the decks in a format to be shared

Optional, but helpful:

1. https://desktop.github.com to manipulate github without using the terminal

## Pull Requests

### Submit a pull request

Fork the [project repository](https://github.com/Victor-Palacios/Data_Science_Interview_Questions_using_Cloze_Deletion) on GitHub, clone, develop on a branch and then finally submit a pull request. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the project repository. Click on the ‘Fork’ button near the top of the page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub.

2. Clone your fork of this project from your GitHub account:

3. Create a branch to hold your changes: Always branch out from `master` to work on your contribution. It's good practice to never work on the `master` branch.

4. Work on your contribution. 

5. Finally, push them to your GitHub fork:

Now it's time to go to your fork of this project and create a pull request! 
You can [follow these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) to do this.

### Work on your pull request

I recommend that your pull request complies with the following rules:

- Make sure your commit messages follow [the seven rules of a great git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/):
    - Separate subject from body with a blank line
    - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
    - Capitalize the subject line
    - Do not end the subject line with a period
    - Use the imperative mood in the subject line (Example: Clean your room)
    - Wrap the body at 72 characters
    - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
